the whole point of parsing every argument seperatly was to keep track of which arg had failed for
the infomative msg, that's why the first sscanf use is general extrcation of strings out of input.

i've used global variables although it's not the best practice due to the guidance about not using
poinnters.

I could really use an advice about the overkill that I had in this exercise, not the first time I
ruin my life with to complicated implementation in school (cause spending 2.5 days for parsing text
is way to much).
